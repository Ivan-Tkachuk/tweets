# React homework template

This project was created with the help of
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## How it works

When you click on the Follow button, the text changes to Following. The color of the button also changes. And yours is added to the number of followers.
If you click on the button and refresh the page, the button still remains in the Following state with the appropriate color, and the number of followers does NOT decrease to the initial value.
When you click the button again, its text and color change to their original state. The number of followers also changes. It decreases by 1.
